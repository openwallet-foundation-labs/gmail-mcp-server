# Gmail TMCP Server

This is an experimental TMCP server that allows you to send emails via Gmail for demo purposes.

The client secret is stored and retrieved within the TSP Askar wallet. To set the client secret, use the following command with the contents of the client secret JSON file downloaded from the Google Cloud console:

```sh
tsp secret add gmail '{"installed":{"client_id":"...","project_id":"...","auth_uri":"...","token_uri":"...","auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"...","client_secret":"...","redirect_uris":["..."]}}'
```

After setting your client secret, run the Gmail server with:

```sh
uv run gmail_server.py
```

The server will then ask you to log in with the Gmail account you want to send emails from.

# Original description:

A powerful and flexible Gmail integration server built using the MCP (Message Control Protocol) framework. This server provides a robust interface to interact with Gmail APIs, offering functionality for reading, sending, and managing emails programmatically.

## Features

- Read emails from multiple Gmail accounts
- Send emails with attachments
- Search emails with advanced query options
- Download email attachments
- Handle email conversations and threads
- Real-time email monitoring
- Support for multiple Gmail accounts

## Prerequisites

Before running the Gmail MCP server, ensure you have the following:

1. Python 3.12 or higher
2. Google Cloud Project with Gmail API enabled
3. OAuth 2.0 Client ID credentials
4. Required Python packages (specified in pyproject.toml)

## Installation

### Installing via Smithery

To install Gmail Integration Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@Quantum-369/Gmail-mcp-server):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @Quantum-369/Gmail-mcp-server --client claude
```

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd gmail-mcp-server
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix/MacOS
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install .
```

## Running on Ubuntu

1. Install Python 3.12 and create a virtual environment if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3.12 python3.12-venv -y
   python3.12 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Place your downloaded `client_secret.json` in the project root.
3. Generate an OAuth token for the Gmail account you want to use. Copy the URL
   printed by the script into a web browser and complete the sign-in process:
   ```bash
   python gmail_token_creator.py
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python gmail_server.py
   ```

## Setup Google Cloud Project

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Gmail API for your project
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
   - Choose "Desktop app" as application type
   - Download the client configuration file
5. Rename the downloaded file to `client_secret.json` and place it in the project root directory

## Configuration

1. Set up email identifiers in `gmail_token_creator.py`:

```python
email_identifier = 'your.email@gmail.com'  # Change this for each account
```

2. Run the token creator to authenticate your Gmail accounts:

```bash
python gmail_token_creator.py
```

The script prints an authorization URL. Copy this URL into your web browser,
complete the Google consent flow, and copy the verification code back into the
terminal if prompted. A token file will be created inside `token_files/` for
future use.

3. Repeat the process for each Gmail account you want to integrate

## Server Structure

- `gmail_server.py`: Main MCP server implementation
- `gmail_api.py`: Gmail API interaction functions
- `google_apis.py`: Google API authentication utilities
- Supporting files:
  - `read_emails.py`: Email reading functionality
  - `search_emails.py`: Email search functionality
  - `send_emails.py`: Email sending functionality

## Usage

### Starting the Server

```bash
python gmail_server.py
```

### Running with Docker

You can also build a container image using the provided `Dockerfile`:

```bash
docker build -t gmail-mcp-server .
docker run -v $(pwd)/client_secret.json:/app/client_secret.json \
           -v $(pwd)/token_files:/app/token_files gmail-mcp-server
```

The container runs the same server and stores authentication tokens in the
`token_files` directory on the host so they persist between runs.

### Available Tools

1. Send Email:

```python
await send_gmail(
    email_identifier="your.email@gmail.com",
    to="recipient@example.com",
    subject="Test Subject",
    body="Email body content",
    attachment_paths=["path/to/attachment"]
)
```

2. Search Emails:

```python
await search_email_tool(
    email_identifier="your.email@gmail.com",
    query="from:someone@example.com",
    max_results=30,
    include_conversations=True
)
```

3. Read Latest Emails:

```python
await read_latest_emails(
    email_identifier="your.email@gmail.com",
    max_results=5,
    download_attachments=False
)
```

4. Download Attachments:

```python
await download_email_attachments(
    email_identifier="your.email@gmail.com",
    msg_id="message_id",
    download_all_in_thread=False
)
```

## Security Considerations

- Store `client_secret.json` securely and never commit it to version control
- Keep token files secure and add them to `.gitignore`
- Use environment variables for sensitive information
- Regularly rotate OAuth credentials
- Monitor API usage and set appropriate quotas

## Error Handling

The server includes comprehensive error handling and logging:

- Logs are written to `gmail_mcp.log`
- Both file and console logging are enabled
- Detailed error messages for debugging
